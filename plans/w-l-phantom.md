# Water/Lipid Phantom Preparation

## Overview
* Acquire scans with stationary and moving phantoms in standard scan mode, at different rotation times, heart rate, and detector collimation. Establish a method of measuring water and lipid mass from cardiac scans
* Adjust water and lipid mass measurement to account for scans acquired in spectral scan mode. Assess the accuracy of water and lipid mass from cardiac scans acquired in spectral scan mode

## Solution Preparation
* Paper: https://www.osapublishing.org/boe/fulltext.cfm?uri=boe-9-11-5792&id=400038

### Materials
* Canola Oil (Brand: Trader Joe’s)
* Soybean lecithin (Brand: Landor Trading Company)
* Oil solidifying agent (Brand: Daiso Japan ?)
* Oil solidifying agent (Brand: The Seaweed Solution)
* Vacuum filter
* Fine mesh net strainer
* Distilled water

### Oil/Oil-Solidifying Agent
* Prepare 100 mL of canola oil (Trader Joe’s brand, ρ = 0.936 g/mL) [200 mL = 187.2 g]
* Add 5 wt% (4.680 g) of the oil-solidifying agent [9.36 g]
* Mix with a glass rod until agent dissolves
* Add 1 wt% (0.936 g) of soy lecithin [1.872 g] 
* Mix with a glass rod until lecithin dissolves
* Mix with hand blender
* Heat to ~85 ºC while stirring with a glass rod
* While the liquid is still hot and non-viscous, place the liquid in a vacuum chamber to remove any air bubbles (Note: if the liquid is hard at all this step will not work)

### Water/Agar
* Prepare 100 mL of water (ρ = 1.00 g/mL) [400 mL]
Boil water
* Add 5 wt% (5.000 g) of agar [20 g]
* Mix with a glass rod until agent dissolves
* Mix with hand blender
* While the liquid is still hot and non-viscous, place the liquid in a vacuum chamber to remove any air bubbles (Note: if the liquid is hard at all this step will not work)
* Cool to ~85 ºC while stirring with glass rod (Note: keep liquid from hardening without overheating and boiling off the water)
